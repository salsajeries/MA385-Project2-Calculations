# MA385-Project2-Calculations

This python program generates a histogram for the arsenic concentrations of apple juice samples from 2019-2023. It also calculates the confidence intervals for each year and returns any relevant statistics needed in order to calculate said confidence interval (mean, standard deviation, etc). The program uses matplotlib.pyplot to display the histogram, scipy for computing mean and standard deviation, and numpy to perform some miscellaneous calculations and to manage the data arrays.
